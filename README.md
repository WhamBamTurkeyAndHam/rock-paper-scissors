This is my first project using Javascript. In this I will create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

Initially this is only going to be shown in the console.


UI Update: After a long time of designing, I have now got it into a state that I am happy with, with the main part of this update allowing the game to be played and displayed on the main page.

I really like how a lot of what I did was just making alterations to things I had learnt so far, like using an array to store color codes for the gradient, or functions like enableButtons() to only allow the enabling of the buttons after all the animations are done.

I did, however, use animations that I wasn't taught at this moment. But I wanted to try and research simple animations myself as an extra challenge, and also because I wanted to try design it so it looked nice.

The only thing that wasn't designed by me was the confetti used by this person, who has stated it could be used.
